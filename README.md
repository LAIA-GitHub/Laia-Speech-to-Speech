# Laia-Speech-to-Speech
## The Project
We have created Laia, a machine learning device that learns from the input of the locals, that works with a dataset made from the information and knowledge of the people of El Clot. To complement and develop Laia we have asked the help of the communities, their feedback and input has been crucial to create the dataset and the voice of Laia. Laia has passed form being an artificial intelligence, to a collective intelligence.  Laia can help us come together as a community, preserve local knowledge and culture, promote small neighborhood initiatives, learn from each other, and break the individual bubble in which we live. Additionally, Laia will be the perfect ally for newcomers coming from distant places to better understand the fabric of the neighborhood and integrate in a respectful manner.

## The machine

### Materials
- Raspberry Pi
- Button
- Microphone (USB)
- Speaker (minijack) Alternatively a bluethooth speaker can act as microphone and speaker at the same time
- Arduino Board
- LED stripe
- Wood board (2500x1225x15)
- Wood board (2500x1225x9)
- Flexible wood board (2500x1225x5)
- Cork
- Transparent acrylic
- Red paint
- Blue spray

### Digital fabrication
For the digital fabrication part of the machine, we used CNC for the wood to create a 600x2000mm column. The column stood thanks to 5 600mm circles that had 4 pockets to join with the cross pieces. Apart from the column structure, we used flexible wood and cork to make the cover.

1. CNC

You will find the CNC files in this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zbs4yTX24mIfkxFVc0-EblyyYPEv2KrE?usp=sharing 

Board 1 should be 2500x1225x15mm
Board 2 should be 2500x1225x9mm

2. Enseble the structure

3. Cut the flexible wood pieces: in our case, we wanted to cover the bottom and top part fully.
The perimeter of the 600mm circles is 1880mm.
The height of the bottom part is 1000mm and the heigh of the top part is 200mm

This leavus us with a 1880x1000mm and a 1880x200mm parts.

4. Cut the cork: for the cork, we wanted to cover 2/4 parts of the midle section of the column.
The two pieces are the same, 470x818mm

5. Paint blue: for the inside open parts.
6. Paint red: all of the covers of the column, flexible wood and cork.

7. Ensemble the pieces with nails or Velcro stripes (this step is still on the works...)
8. Add the electronics (this step is still on the works...)
